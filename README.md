I have used the following algorithms on the Iris Classification dataset provided in the repository to determine which of these algorithms had the most accurate results

# Linear Algorithms

## Logistic Regression
LR: 0.941667 (0.065085)

## Linear Discriminant Analysis
LDA: 0.975000 (0.038188)

# Non linear algorithms

## K nearest neighbours
KNN: 0.958333 (0.041667)

## Classification and Regression Trees

## Gaussian Naive Bayes
NB: 0.950000 (0.055277)

## Support Vector Machines
SVM: 0.983333 (0.033333)
