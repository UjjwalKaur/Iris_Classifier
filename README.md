I have used the following algorithms on the Iris Classification dataset provided in the repository to determine which of these algorithms had the most accurate results

## Linear aglorithms

## Logistic Regression

## Linear Discriminant Analysis

## Non linear algorithms

## K nearest neighbours

## Classification and Regression Trees

## Gaussian Naive Bayes

## Support Vector Machines
